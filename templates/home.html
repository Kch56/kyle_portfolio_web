        <h2>Who Am I?</h2>
        <p>
            I’m a data science student and systems thinker focused on building tools that improve how organizations make decisions. 
            My work blends analytics, GIS, and application development to design intelligent systems not just dashboards, but 
            frameworks that support real operational strategy.
        </p>

        <p>
            At the Charlotte Fire Department, I work on response modeling, spatial risk analysis, and decision-support concepts 
            that connect data to action. From hex-based coverage modeling to exploring GeoAI capabilities, I focus on making 
            complex systems measurable, explainable, and practical.
        </p>

        <p>
            I’m driven by one core idea: technology should reduce uncertainty, increase clarity, and make better decisions possible.
